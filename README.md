# neuromaps

The neuromaps toolbox is designed to help researchers make easy, statistically-rigorous comparisons between brain maps (or brain annotations). Documentation can be found [here](https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/).

The accompanying paper is published in [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01625-w) ([postprint](https://github.com/netneurolab/neuromaps/blob/main/markello2022natmethods.pdf)).

# annotated connectomics

neuromaps is a great tool for annotated connectomics. See our recent review published in [Nature Reviews Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-023-00752-3)
